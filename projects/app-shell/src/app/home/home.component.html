<h2>Experimental webpack 5 Support</h2>
<p>Now, teams can opt-in to webpack v5. Currently, you could experiment with module federation. In the future, webpack v5 will clear the path for:</p>
<ul><li>Faster builds with persistent disk caching</li>
<li>Smaller bundles thanks to cjs tree-shaking</li></ul>
<p>Support is experimental and under development so we donâ€™t recommend opting in for production uses.</p>
